# To-Do-List-App

#### This app allows users to add up to 10 tasks on a todo list. Tasks entered are stored in a database called ToDoList found on the main branch of this repository. 
#### The user can delete tasks from the list by pressing a button. All tasks and therefore all rows of the database can be deleted by pressing the delete all button.
